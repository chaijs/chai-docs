This plugin makes it easier to remove those properties from comparison.\n\nhttps://github.com/chaijs/chai/issues/885\n\nWorks with both array of objects and objects.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install chai-exclude --only=dev\n```\n\n```bash\nyarn add chai-exclude --dev\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Require\n\n```js\nconst chai = require('chai');\nconst chaiExclude = require('chai-exclude');\n\nchai.use(chaiExclude);\n```\n\n### ES6 Import\n\n```js\nimport { use } from 'chai';\nimport chaiExclude from 'chai-exclude';\n\nuse(chaiExclude);\n```\n\n### TypeScript\n\n```js\nimport { use } from 'chai';\nimport chaiExclude = require('chai-exclude');\n\nuse(chaiExclude);\n\n// The typings for chai-exclude are included with the package itself.\n```\n\n## Example\n\n### a) excluding\n\n1. Excluding a top level property from an object\n\n```js\n// Object\nassert.deepEqualExcluding({ a: 'a', b: 'b' }, { b: 'b' }, 'a')\nassert.deepEqualExcluding({ a: 'a', b: 'b' }, { a: 'z', b: 'b' }, 'a')\n\nexpect({ a: 'a', b: 'b' }).excluding('a').to.deep.equal({ b: 'b' })\nexpect({ a: 'a', b: 'b' }).excluding('a').to.deep.equal({ a: 'z', b: 'b' })\n\n// Array\nassert.deepEqualExcluding([{ a: 'a', b: 'b' }], [{ b: 'b' }], 'a')\nassert.deepEqualExcluding([{ a: 'a', b: 'b' }], [{ a: 'z', b: 'b' }], 'a')\n\nexpect([{ a: 'a', b: 'b' }]).excluding('a').to.deep.equal([{ b: 'b' }])\nexpect([{ a: 'a', b: 'b' }]).excluding('a').to.deep.equal([{ a: 'z', b: 'b' }])\n```\n\n2. Excluding multiple top level properties from an object\n\n```js\nconst obj = {\n  a: 'a',\n  b: 'b',\n  c: {\n    d: 'd',\n    e: 'e'\n  }\n}\n\n// Object\nassert.deepEqualExcluding(obj, { b: 'b' }, ['a', 'c'])\nassert.deepEqualExcluding(obj, { a: 'z', b: 'b' }, ['a', 'c'])\n\nexpect(obj).excluding(['a', 'c']).to.deep.equal({ b: 'b' })\nexpect(obj).excluding(['a', 'c']).to.deep.equal({ a: 'z', b: 'b' })\n\nconst array = [\n  {\n    a: 'a',\n    b: 'b',\n    c: {\n      d: 'd',\n      e: 'e'\n    }\n  }\n]\n\n// Array\nassert.deepEqualExcluding(array, [{ b: 'b' }], ['a', 'c'])\nassert.deepEqualExcluding(array, [{ a: 'z', b: 'b' }], ['a', 'c'])\n\nexpect(array).excluding(['a', 'c']).to.deep.equal([{ b: 'b' }])\nexpect(array).excluding(['a', 'c']).to.deep.equal([{ a: 'z', b: 'b' }])\n```\n\n### b) excludingEvery\n\n1. Excluding every property in a deeply nested object\n\n```js\nconst actualObj = {\n  a: 'a',\n  b: 'b',\n  c: {\n    a: 'a',\n    b: {\n      a: 'a',\n      d: {\n        a: 'a',\n        b: 'b',\n        d: null\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  d: ['a', 'c']\n}\n\nconst actualArray = [actualObj]\n\nconst expectedObj = {\n  a: 'z',     // a is excluded from comparison\n  b: 'b',\n  c: {\n    b: {\n      d: {\n        b: 'b',\n        d: null\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  d: ['a', 'c']\n}\n\nconst expectedArray = [expectedObj]\n\n// Object\nassert.deepEqualExcludingEvery(actualObj, expectedObj, 'a')\nexpect(actualObj).excludingEvery('a').to.deep.equal(expectedObj)\n\n// Array\nassert.deepEqualExcludingEvery(actualArray, expectedArray, 'a')\nexpect(actualArray).excludingEvery('a').to.deep.equal(expectedArray)\n```\n\n2. Excluding multiple properties in a deeply nested object\n\n```js\nconst actualObj = {\n  a: 'a',\n  b: 'b',\n  c: {\n    a: 'a',\n    b: {\n      a: 'a',\n      d: {\n        a: 'a',\n        b: 'b',\n        d: null\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  d: ['a', 'c']\n}\n\nconst actualArray = [actualObj]\n\nconst expectedObj = {\n  b: 'b',\n  c: {\n    b: {\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst expectedArray = [expectedObj]\n\n// Object\nassert.deepEqualExcludingEvery(actualObj, expectedObj, ['a', 'd'])\nexpect(actualObj).excludingEvery(['a', 'd']).to.deep.equal(expectedObj)\n\n// Array\nassert.deepEqualExcludingEvery(actualArray, expectedArray, ['a', 'd'])\nexpect(actualArray).excludingEvery(['a', 'd']).to.deep.equal(expectedArray)\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome.
