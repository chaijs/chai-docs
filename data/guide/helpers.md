Providing chainable helper assertions is the most common use of the plugin utilities
that Chai exposes. Before we get into the basics, we are going to need a topic 
for which we will extend Chai's assertions to comprehend. For this, we will be
using a very minimal data model object. 

```javascript
/**
 * # Model
 *
 * A constructor for a simple data model
 * object. Has a `type` and contains arbitrary
 * attributes.
 *
 * @param {String} type
 */

function Model (type) {
  this._type = type;
  this._attrs = {};
}

/**
 * .set (key, value)
 *
 * Set an attribute to be stored in this model.
 *
 * @param {String} key
 * @param {Mixted} value
 */

Model.prototype.set = function (key, value) {
  this._attrs[key] = value;
};

/**
 * .set (key, value)
 *
 * Get an attribute that is stored in this model.
 *
 * @param {String} key
 */

Model.prototype.get = function (key) {
  return this._attrs[key];
};
```

Practically speaking, this could be any data model object returned from a 
ORM database in node or constructed from your MVC framework of choice in 
the browser. 

Hopefully our `Model` class is self explanatory, but as an example,
here we construct a person object.

```javascript
var arthur = new Model('person');
arthur.set('name', 'Arthur Dent');
arthur.set('occupation', 'traveller');
console.log(arthur.get('name')); // Arthur Dent
```

Now that we have our subject, we can move on to the basics of plugins.
